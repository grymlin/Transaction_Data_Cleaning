# Cafe Sales Data Cleaning

This project demonstrates how to clean, validate, and visualize transaction data from a cafe sales dataset. It addresses common data quality issues such as missing values, inconsistent formats, invalid entries, and outliers. The workflow includes both code and visualizations to help understand the impact of each cleaning step.
